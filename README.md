 A vegetable market is a place where fresh vegetables and sometimes fruits are sold. It is usually a busy and colorful place, filled with different kinds of vegetables like tomatoes, 
potatoes, onions, carrots, and many more. Farmers or sellers bring their produce early in the morning, and customers come to buy fresh items at reasonable prices. The market often has small stalls or open spaces where vendors display their vegetables in baskets or on mats. It is full of noise, bargaining, and activity, especially during the morning hours.
